# Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project explores the classic **Boston Housing dataset** to predict the **median home value (MEDV)** using various features describing neighborhoods and housing characteristics. The project includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, multicollinearity checks, baseline linear modeling, tree-based models, and model interpretability using Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs).
